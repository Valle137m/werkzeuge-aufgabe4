'Twas a long time ago, longer now than it seems
In a place that perhaps you've seen in your dreams.
For the story that you are about to be told
Took place with the holiday worlds of old.

Now, you've probably wondered where holidays come from.
If you haven't, I'd say it's time you begun.
For holidays are the result of much fuss
And hard work for the worlds that create them for us.
Well, you see now, quite simply that's all that they do--
Making one unique holiday, especially for you.
But once, a calamity ever so great occurred
When two holidays met by mistake.
